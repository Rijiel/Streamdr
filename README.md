# Streamdr - a streamer simulator game

This is a school project where we developed a storyboard and I programmed all functionalities. This project was purely coded using Finite State Machines (PlayMaker).

## Gameplay
Players must balance decisions affecting four factors: money, popularity, connections, and mental health, leading to multiple possible endings. The main goal of this game is to not get cancelled on the internet as a content creator, until you reach one of the 4 endings. 
There will be special events such as Beef with Another Content Creator, Collabs and E-date.
